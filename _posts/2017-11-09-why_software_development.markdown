     Deciding to learn software developing was a fairly easy decision for me. I have always been into computers and fascinated with the idea of working online in some way or another. This initially introduced me to stock trading, which I fell in love with. I then took a teaching job in Jakarta, Indonesia and continued to trade from home. While trading does offer the ability to work from anywhere as well as a lot of excitement, it is far from reliable. 
		 
		 After about a year of this routine I grew very bored of my day job as well as homesick. I knew I could not go back to the U.S. and teach nor could I soley rely on day trading. So, I started looking around online as well as watching copious amounts of youtube videos until I came across the idea of programming. I knew programmers did well but I had no real idea of what went into it besides that fact that there were hundreds of languages. 
		 
		 Once I completed an amount of research I was satified with I decided to get an introduction and try out a free website called freecodecamp.com. It was here that I fell in love with all that is development. It's such an amazing thing and one of the most valuable skills a person can possess. This source was a fantastic introduction in the way that it, in a lot of ways, basically told you what to type, why you were doing it,  and what it did. It was perfect for feeling like I was actually accomplishing something and had me thinking I was learning more than I actually was. Although I didnt stick with that program it had spurred my obsession with learning this skill. 
		 
		 Finally, after spending quite some time looking into the best ways to learn, the best schools, best bootcamps, and best communities, I had found FlatIron. Once I was satisfied that it was the place for me I applied and have thus far hit the ground running and im very happy with everything the school is. I look forward to finishing the program and having several languages under my belt so that I can begin my career as a software developer.
