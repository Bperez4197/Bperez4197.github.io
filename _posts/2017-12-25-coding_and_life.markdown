Coding can relate to just about anything in life. We are constantly faced with very big problems that we must break into smaller pieces if we have any hope of overcoming them. This happens all the time usually without anyone noticing. If coding is nothing else, it is developing extremely strong problem solving skills.

Take fitness for instance. One day you decide you want to lose 20lbs and gain some muscle, great! However, if you try to do it all at once you will mostly like hurt yourself in some way or even more likely, quit. You have to break it all down into separate issues. First, you have to fix your diet, which your break down even further simply eliminating bad foods and sodas and such. Then you'll have to concentrate on preparing your meals and summoning the motivation to spend a lot more of your time cooking. Then, you want to gain some muscle. If you jump in the gym and start throwing around weight that you can't properly handle you'll be in a lot of pain with very minimal results. It comes from starting with basic excersises and slowly increasing resistance over time. Then you want to do some cardio. If you head in the first day and run 10 miles, you probably won't be doing it again and it could even make you want to quit on everything else. First, you walk on and incline, then you add some resistance, then you can run, and then you can sprint. 

All of this is just like coding. If you go to hard right out of the gate and you'll run out of steam and want to give up on any progress you have made. If the first thing you try to do is build a ridiculously complicated app, you'll probably quit after a few days. However, just like fitness, when you take the long term approach and break things down into small problems, giving yourself small wins on a regular basis, you are much more likely to succeed at what you are attempting.
