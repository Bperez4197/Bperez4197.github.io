If I were going to offer some advice to someone who was just starting out trying to complete OO Tic Tac Toe I would start with the importance of their "Why?".  When picking up anything, expecially something that can be very difficult, It is imperative to constantly remind yourself why it is youre putting yourself through this. If you can maintain a strong "Why?", you will be successful. 

Next I would stress the importance of understanding. It is not enough to go through the lessons, do the labs, pass the quizzes and get the result. It is crucial to understand why what is working, is working. Understand how the code works, why it works, and a few different ways you could do the same thing to make sure your fully comprehend the task at hand. Take the time to looked at some of the recourses at the bottom of labs, take extensive notes, quiz yourself when you need to kill time, whatever it takes it what is necessary.

Thanks to my comprehensive notes on procedural ruby and that Tic Tac Toe assignment, I actually didnt find the OO version all that difficult. But when you do get stuck, google is your best friend. However, as I said before, it is not enough to go find the answer. You absolutely have to understand what you were doing wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. There is no better feeling in this course than seeing those green lights when completing a lab, but forcing yourself to solidify that knowledge is what makes the lasting difference. When you find a reason to skip a day or walk away from a lab, remember why you want this and get it done.
